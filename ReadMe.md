#Penguin Hockey
Penguin Hockey is a simple multiplayer game being developed in Unity as an example/experiment for my Game Development Class. Each player plays the part of a single penguin, on a platform of ice, with the goal of knocking each other off the ice and into the surrounding water.

##Current Features
* Local multiplayer with 2, 3, or 4 players
* Main menu with funny-looking AIs playing in the background
* Support for Xbox 360 controllers (no keyboard support)

##Planned Features
* Online multiplayer functionality
* Multiplayer Lobbies for creating and finding matches
* Leaderboard? (maybe not)
* Refined win-state
* Alternate game modes
